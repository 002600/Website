      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our Website Development Program introduces middle school students to the
        fundamentals of building websites from the ground up. Over four weeks,
        students learn how to structure pages with HTML, style them with CSS,
        and bring pages to life with JavaScript. Each lesson is taught through
        CodeSandbox hands-on activities so students can immediately apply what
        they learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course blends instruction with practice, encouraging students to
        experiment, debug, and creatively solve real coding problems. Students
        gain confidence as they progress from simple webpage structures to fully
        interactive pages. Every session includes fun facts, tech career
        spotlights, and coding challenges to spark curiosity and expose students
        to the possibilities within computer science. Students will also engage
        in discussions of ethical applications in technology, such as privacy,
        accessibility, and responsible content creation. By the end of the
        program, students will have built their own mini-websites and
        interactive features, all while learning how developers think, work, and
        create. This course is designed to be supportive, fun, and accessible to
        complete beginners while still pushing students to think critically and
        explore STEM pathways.

        Mentorship is available upon request for students who want to expand
        their skills beyond the course. Through personalized guidance, students
        can explore areas such as graphic design, UX/UI design, and portfolio
        development. Additionally, mentorship can provide career guidance in
        technology and STEM, helping students gain insight into professional
        pathways and build a stronger foundation for future projects and
        opportunities.
