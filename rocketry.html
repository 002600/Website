      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our Rocketry Course introduces middle school students to the exciting
        world of aerospace engineering through a highly engaging, hands-on
        learning experience. Over six weeks, students develop technical skills
        in aerodynamics, propulsion, stability, thrust-to-weight calculations,
        flight dynamics, and recovery systems. They learn to read design
        diagrams, evaluate fin configurations, and understand how real rockets
        are engineered, all while practicing safe construction and launch
        procedures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students will engage in building paper planes, mini rockets, and
        medium-sized rockets, each constructed collaboratively in small groups.
        While these rockets are crafted rather than launched, students gain
        experience in design, assembly, and testing concepts. They will also be
        introduced to OpenRocket software for flight simulation, helping them
        visualize rocket trajectories and experiment with design choices in a
        virtual environment. Students will also engage in discussions of ethical
        applications in technology, including safety, environmental impact, and
        responsible engineering practices. The course balances technical
        skill-building with interactive and engaging elements. Fun facts,
        problem-solving challenges, discussion breaks, and STEM career
        spotlights in aerospace keep students motivated and curious. Students
        also strengthen teamwork, leadership, communication, and critical
        thinking as they collaborate on design decisions and troubleshoot
        construction issues in a safe, respectful, and scientifically rigorous
        environment.
