      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Our Hardware & Arduino Engineering course immerses students in the world
        of electronics, coding, prototyping and physical computing. O Over eight
        weeks, students learn technical skills including reading and creating
        circuit schematics, building circuits on breadboards, using sensors and
        actuators, programming Arduino boards in C/C++, debugging hardware and
        integrating components into functional devices. Each week introduces a
        new hands-on project, such as a weather station, traffic light system or
        security sensor, allowing students to apply concepts in practical,
        tangible ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to technical skills, students explore real-world engineering
        applications, learning how similar technologies are used in industry,
        how to scale up small projects and how to source materials for larger
        systems. The course emphasizes interactive learning, including
        problem-solving challenges, fun facts, short breaks and opportunities to
        reflect on engineering choices. Students also strengthen teamwork,
        persistence, analytical reasoning, and creative problem-solving as they
        troubleshoot, iterate and refine their designs. Students will also
        engage in discussions of ethical applications in technology, considering
        safety, responsible design and the social impact of their projects. By
        the end of the course, students will have built multiple functional
        projects, gained confidence in electronics and coding, and developed an
        understanding of how to apply these skills in real-world contexts.
        Career exploration is woven throughout, helping students discover
        potential paths in engineering, robotics, and related STEM fields, while
        reinforcing the importance of systematic thinking, clear documentation,
        and innovation.
